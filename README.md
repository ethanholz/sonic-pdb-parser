# Sonic PDB Parser
A WIP sonic-speed PDB parser written in Zig.

## Usage
`main -r <runs> -f <file> -o <output>`
- `-r` -> specifies the number of times to run test, if r = 1, this will dump the parsed file as a JSON
- `-f` -> specifies the file you want to parse
- `-o` -> specifies the CSV you want to output to
